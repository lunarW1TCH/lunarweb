### Introduction

This is probably the project that made me grow the most as a software developer.

<br />

Minos required me to work with Arduino devices, figure out how the actual hardware works and program a bit in C++.

<br />

<br />

Arduinos were communicating through radio modules with Raspberry Pi devices which were communicating through Socket.IO with frontend app.

<br />

The whole project required me to setup two systems of communication as well as frontend and backend application to control it.
