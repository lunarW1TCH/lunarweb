A simple website built with [Astro](https://astro.build/).

<br />

For the first version of this website I used React along with EmotionCSS for styling (I am a huge fan of CSS-in-JS).

<br />

Not long after that I rebuilt it with NextJS and PandaCSS. Both frameworks are designed to mix the modern, reactive way of building websites with the performance and stability of pre-rendered content.

<br />

Half a year later I started working on current version of Lunarweb. This time utilizing
the modular framework Astro which is amazing for building mostly-static websites
like this one.

<br />

### How it's built

<br />

Content of all **/projects** pages is written with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), which is a way of mixing JavaScript components (~~React~~ Vue and Astro in my case) with syntax of Markdown. Astro has a great support for it. Below you can see a fragment of how it looks like. Along with syntax highlighting which I am utilizing in some examples.

<br />

```mdx
import { Github } from 'lucide-astro'; // regular astro component

import { mapComponents } from '~/components/mdx/mapped-components.astro';
export const components = mapComponents(); // importing components which will be mapped to corresponding markdown syntax

{/* ... some stuff ... */}

<br />

MDX and Markdown have support for optional frontmatter blocks written with YAML syntax. They allow to add some metadata to your files which is not displayed once rendered. [Here's a great overview of how it actually works.](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/) Also that's how frontmatter for this file looks like:
