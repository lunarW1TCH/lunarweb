import { mapComponents } from '~/components/mdx/mapped-components.astro';
import { Link } from '~/components/ui/link';
export const components = mapComponents(['h2', 'p', 'pre']);

## Lunarweb

A simple website built with <Link href='https://astro.build/'>Astro</Link>.

<br />

For the first version of this website I used React along with EmotionCSS for styling (I am a huge fan of CSS-in-JS).

<br />

Not long after that I rebuilt it with NextJS and PandaCSS. Both frameworks are designed to mix the modern, reactive way of building websites combined with the performance and stability of pre-rendered content.

<br />
Half a year later I started working on current version of Lunarweb. This time utilizing
the modular framework Astro which is amazing for building mostly-static websites
like this one.

<br />

Content of all **/projects** pages is written with <Link href='https://mdxjs.com/'>MDX</Link>, which is a way of mixing React components with syntax of Markdown. Astro has a great support for it. Below you can see a fragment of how it looks like. Along with syntax highlighting which I am utilizing heavily on **/docs** pages.

<br />

```mdx
import { mapComponents } from '~/components/mdx/mapped-components.astro';
import { Link } from '~/components/ui/link';
export const components = mapComponents([], true);
